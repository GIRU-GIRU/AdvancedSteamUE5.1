# AdvancedSteamUE5.1

Deep Steam integration with UE is painful and inintuitive, the existing OSS (Online Subsystems) are also being deprecated in favour of OnlineServices. However, if you still want to roll your own Steam integration with platform specific functionalities then there are some in here

This plugin is not a library, it's a learning / training resource. If you want a lib then i'd suggest looked at AdvancedSteamSessions
